  Course Policies:

<p class="coursePol_det">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Course Website & Participation: Students are required to periodically check the course
website and download course material as needed. Several resources will be posted through the
website as well. Keys to quizzes and exams are generally discussed during class as time permits

but solutions will not be posted. Blackboard CE 9.1 will be used for communication and
interaction, posting and submitting assignments, posting grades, posting sample exams, etc. It is
expected that you get benefit of the discussion board by raising questions or answering
questions put by others. Up to 5% bonus will be granted for giving a short presentation on a
related topic/tool/technology.
    </li>
    <li>
      Class attendance: Regular attendance is a university requirement; hence attendance will be
  checked at the beginning of each class. Late arrivals will disrupt the class session. Hence, two
  late attendances (more than 10 minutes) will be considered as one absence. If you are 15 minutes
  late, you will be marked as absent and will not be permitted to enter the class. More importantly,
  you are not allowed to leave the class unless it is an urgent matter. Missing more than 6 lectures
  will result in a DN grade without prior warning. To avoid being considered as absent, an official
  excuse must be shown no later than one week of returning to classes. Every unexcused absence
  leads to a loss of 0.5% of total grade
    </li>
    <li>
      No makeup of homework, quizzes or exams will be given
    </li>
    <li>
      Re-grading policy: If you have a complaint about any of your grades, discuss it with the
instructor no later than a week of distributing the grades (except for the final, an office hour
will be announced in Blackboard after grading in which complains can be raised, if any). Only
legitimate concerns on grading should be discussed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Term Project: Group work, each group of 3 students is expected to design and implement a web
application following the systematic approach for web engineering. Around the third week, the
instructor will provide you with a requirement document, then each group should go through all
different phases web engineering and development. Innovative ideas are highly encouraged and
will be rewarded in the project grade. All group members are expected to know all the details
about the project. More information about deliverables on Blackboard.
    </li>
    <li>
      Academic honesty: Students are expected to abide by all the university regulations on academic
honesty. Cheating will be reported to the Department Chairman and will be severely penalized.
Although collaboration and sharing knowledge is highly encouraged, copying others’ work without
proper citation, either in part or full, is considered plagiarism. Whenever in doubt, review the
university guidelines or consult the instructor. Cheating in whatever form will result in F grade.
    </li>
    <li>
      Courtesy: Students are expected to be courteous toward the instructor and their classmates
throughout the duration of this course. Talking while someone else is speaking will not be
tolerated. Furthermore, all cell phones must be turned off during class and exams. In addition,
students are expected to be in class on time. To contact your instructor, please keep all
communications, except in urgent matters, through Blackboard and avoid using phone calls,
university emails or written notes. When sending an email through the university email system,
please indicate 172-SWE363 in the "Subject" field of your email, e.g. 172-SWE363: Question
about homework 1. Not following properly these guidelines may result in late or no response of
your email.
