  Course Policies:
</p>
<p class="coursePol_det">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Coursework includes participation, online/in-class discussions and activities,
attendance, homework assignments, and quizzes. Active learning is implemented in
this class. Students are expected to be positively engaged in the learning process.
    </li>
    <li>
      Course Website & Participation: Students are required to periodically check the
course website and download course material as needed.
    </li>
    <li>
    Attendance: Regular attendance is a university requirement.
    </li>
    <li>
      Late assignments: are subjected to late-penalty. See late submission policy on the
course website/ Blackboard under the Assignments page.
    </li>
    <li>
      Re-grading policy: If you have a complaint about any of your grades, discuss it
  with the instructor no later than 3 days of distributing the grades (except for the
  final). Only legitimate concerns on grading should be discussed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Academic honesty: Students are expected to abide by all the university regulations on academic
honesty. Cheating will be reported to the Department Chairman and will be severely penalized.
Although collaboration and sharing knowledge is highly encouraged, copying others’ work without
proper citation, either in part or full, is considered plagiarism. Whenever in doubt, review the
university guidelines or consult the instructor. Cheating in whatever form will result in F grade.
    </li>
    <li>
      Courtesy: Students are expected to be courteous toward the instructor and their classmates
throughout the duration of this course. Talking while someone else is speaking will not be
tolerated. Furthermore, all cell phones must be turned off during class and exams. In addition,
students are expected to be in class on time. To contact your instructor, please keep all
communications, except in urgent matters, through Blackboard and avoid using phone calls,
university emails or written notes.
